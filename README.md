# TTT-Game

Created with help from co-pilot

Although I didnt mention anywhere (including this README that I was working on a Tic Tac Toe game it correctly contextualized its recommendations

Since I created the basic board 2x array and Cell class, it was good to go with 2x array processing

Since it was a 3x3 grid I assume it was prompted to focus on likely TTT algorithms

just typing comment line `//find row with 3 X's or O's ` in hasWinner method it recommended appropraite code

same with `//find a column with 3 3 X's or O's` and `find a diagonal with 3 X's or O's`

once basics weere down just prompting with method name `play` and `playRandom` recommended complete code

and finally `playRandomUntilGameOver` suggested the loop as it is, i onl added a `printBoard()` call

Since this is a very well trodden algo it was likely trained very well to make recommendations.
